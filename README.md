# model-zoo
Model zoo (in Netlogo) for the book Pattern and Process

This is the collection of [Netlogo](http://github.com/NetLogo) models we built for our book [_Spatial Simulation: Exploring
Pattern and Process_](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119970792.html). The models are also available at
the book website [patternandprocess.org](http://patternandprocess.org).

The purpose of putting the models here, is to speed up the process of adequately commenting them, and also to make it
easier to make minor tweaks and corrections to the code.  Periodically, we will update the copies available on 
[patternandprocess.org](http://patternandprocess.org), but the most current versions will be here.
